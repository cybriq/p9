# glom

Glom is a command line shell, code and script editor and application platform in one.

It keeps a branching history of commands entered, which are either directly Go expressions or API calls in a arbitrary textual form similar to command line options, and can be executed immediately, or deferred until a testable unit is constructed.

The branching logs of commands entered can be grouped into functions, and functions grouped into packages, and then published to distributed content addressable repositories.

Glom stores the content reference to called functions as at the last time they were compiled, ending versioning hell.

Glom allows you to link any and all content to these packages, one can keep a dev journal, write guides, attach video, photographs and so on, right next to the code using document editors that from an early point will be created. 

Last, but not least, it hosts the content you want to share with the world via IPFS or similar peer to peer protocol, the whole relevant history, or just the current state, the code is fingerprinted by its content, signed by its authors.

With it's friendly navigation, even non programmers will be able to write simple linear scripts composed of variables and API calls, and with easy auditing the security of apps created and distributed this way, every last statement can be accounted for and malicious code and its authors pruned from the tree.
