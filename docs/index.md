# Plan 9 from Crypto Space Hard Fork

The hard fork includes the following new features:

- **New Proof of Work hash function** - uses very large integer long 
  division to avert the centralisation of hash power by using
  the slowest and most expensive integer mathematical operation
  already being most optimally implemented in CPUs - long division. 
  GPU dividers are slower and no ASIC could do it faster.
  
- **9 way parallel prime based block intervals** - The blocks come
  in randomly anyway so why not make the schedule semi-random?
  This block product scheduler (difficulty adjustment) runs 9
  parallel block schedules using the new hash function where each
  different block has a different but regular block time with a
  different difficulty target and proportional block reward. 
 
  This allows a broader scale dynamic between small and larger 
  miners, who have different needs for payment regularity.
  The average block time is 36 seconds, which is sufficient
  for many retail operation types.
  
- **Simple zero configuration multicast mining cluster control 
  system** - Using a simple pre-shared key it is easy to add nodes 
  and mining worker machines to a cluster. Simple redundancy by
  the use of multicast one can just run one or more controller
  nodes and the workers just listen to whoever is also using the
  same key. 
  
  A customised live linux USB will be available for 
  both functions with an easy configuration file readable by
  windows for setting the password and payment addresses.

- **Multi-platform touch-friendly wallet GUI** - A responsive and
  simple user interface for making and viewing transactions
  as well as an inbuilt block explorer, configuration and mining
  controls, available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.
